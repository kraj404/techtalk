Let’s take a classic use case of a shopping cart application.  When you open a shopping cart application, all you see is just a website. But, behind the scenes, the shopping   cart application has a service for accepting payments, a service for customer services and so on. Assume that developers of this application have created it in a monolithic framework. 
  
  So, all the features are put together in a single code base and are under a single underlying database. Now, let’s suppose that there is a new brand coming up in the market and developers want to put all the details of the upcoming brand in this application.Then, they not only have to rework on the service for new labels, but they also have to reframe the complete system and deploy it accordingly.To avoid such challenges developers of this application decided to shift their application from a monolithic architecture to a newer architecture. Refer to the diagram below to understand the architecture of shopping cart application
  
  This means that developers don’t create a web microservice, a logic microservice, or a database microservice. Instead, they create separate microservices for search, recommendations, customer services and so on.This type of architecture for the application not only helps the developers to overcome all the challenges faced with the previous architecture but also helps the shopping cart application to be built, deployed, and scale up easily.

# AWS Web Services
https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-overview.pdf
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.

# Two Factor Authentication
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3239144/2fa-explained-how-to-enable-it-and-how-it-works.html
Two-factor authentication (2fa) is a method of establishing access to an online account or computer system that requires the user to provide two different types of information.

A factor in this context simply means a way to convince a computer system or online service that you are who say you are, so the system can determine if you have the rights to access the data services that you're trying to access. By far the most common authentication factor in use today is the username/password pair, and since most accounts only require a password for access, most systems thus use single-factor authentication for security. With two-factor authentication, you'll need to both provide a password and prove your identity some other way to gain access.

# OAuth

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
