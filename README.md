# Micro Service Archicture

  Let’s take a classic use case of a shopping cart application.  When you open a shopping cart application, all you see is just a website. But, behind the scenes, the shopping   cart application has a service for accepting payments, a service for customer services and so on. Assume that developers of this application have created it in a monolithic framework. 
  
  So, all the features are put together in a single code base and are under a single underlying database. Now, let’s suppose that there is a new brand coming up in the market and developers want to put all the details of the upcoming brand in this application.Then, they not only have to rework on the service for new labels, but they also have to reframe the complete system and deploy it accordingly.To avoid such challenges developers of this application decided to shift their application from a monolithic architecture to a newer architecture. Refer to the diagram below to understand the architecture of shopping cart application
  
  This means that developers don’t create a web microservice, a logic microservice, or a database microservice. Instead, they create separate microservices for search, recommendations, customer services and so on.This type of architecture for the application not only helps the developers to overcome all the challenges faced with the previous architecture but also helps the shopping cart application to be built, deployed, and scale up easily.
